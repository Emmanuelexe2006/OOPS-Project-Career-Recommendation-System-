## Implementation

The project is implemented in **Java** using the **Swing** library for the GUI and **SQLite** for the database.

### Java Code Modules

The system is composed of several Java classes, each serving a specific purpose in the application architecture. Below is a detailed explanation of each module:

#### 1. `Main.java`
-   **Purpose:** The entry point of the application.
-   **Functionality:** It contains the `main` method which initializes the database by calling `DatabaseSetup.initializeDatabase()` and then launches the graphical user interface by creating an instance of `CareerGui`.

#### 2. `CareerGui.java`
-   **Purpose:** Manages the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and user interactions.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   Extends `JFrame` to create the main application window.
    -   Implements a custom "Deep Dark" theme with neon green accents (`#1DB954`).
    -   **Components:** Contains text fields for Name and Age, a search bar for skills, and a scrollable checklist (`JCheckBox`) for skill selection.
    -   **Event Handling:** Listens for button clicks (e.g., "Find Careers", "View History") and updates the UI dynamically.
    -   **Custom Rendering:** Uses `Graphics2D` to draw custom buttons and glow effects for the "Best Match" result.
    -   **History Display:** Includes methods to fetch and display user history in a separate dialog window.

#### 3. `CareerEngine.java`
-   **Purpose:** The core logic engine that handles data processing and recommendations.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   Implements the `RecommenderInterface`.
    -   **`recommend(Applicant applicant)`:** The primary algorithm. It fetches all careers from the database, compares their required skills with the applicant's skills, calculates a match score, and returns a sorted list of recommendations.
    -   **`getCareerDetails(String title)`:** Retrieves specific details (salary, difficulty, description) for a given career.
    -   **`generateExplanation(...)`:** Generates an HTML-formatted string explaining *why* a specific career was recommended, highlighting matching skills and difficulty levels.
    -   **History Management:** Contains methods to `saveHistory`, `getHistory`, and `clearHistory` using SQL commands.
    -   **Logging:** Writes system activities and errors to `activity_log.txt`.

#### 4. `DatabaseSetup.java`
-   **Purpose:** Handles database initialization and data seeding.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Connects to the SQLite database (`careers.db`).
    -   Creates the necessary tables: `careers` (stores profession details) and `history` (stores user sessions).
    -   **Data Seeding:** Populates the `careers` table with a comprehensive list of over 50 professions across various industries (Tech, Healthcare, Business, etc.) if the table is empty or reset.

#### 5. `Applicant.java`
-   **Purpose:** A model class representing the user seeking a recommendation.
-   **Structure:**
    -   Extends the `Person` class.
    -   Adds a `skills` attribute (String) to store the comma-separated list of selected skills.
    -   Provides a constructor to initialize the applicant's data and a getter method for skills.

#### 6. `Person.java`
-   **Purpose:** A base class representing a generic person.
-   **Structure:**
    -   Contains common attributes: `name` (String) and `age` (int).
    -   Demonstrates the concept of **Inheritance**, allowing `Applicant` to reuse this code.

#### 7. `RecommenderInterface.java`
-   **Purpose:** Defines a contract for recommendation logic.
-   **Structure:**
    -   Declares the `recommend(Applicant applicant)` method.
    -   Ensures that any future recommendation engine implements this standard method, promoting code modularity and the use of **Interfaces**.

#### 8. `NoCareerFoundException.java`
-   **Purpose:** A custom exception class.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Extends `Exception`.
    -   Used to handle specific scenarios where the recommendation engine cannot find any suitable matches for the user's input, allowing the GUI to display a friendly error message instead of crashing.

#### 9. `AdminCLI.java`
-   **Purpose:** A command-line interface tool for system administrators.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Allows admins to view all available skills in the database.
    -   Provides functionality to add new careers to the database dynamically without modifying the code.
    -   Useful for maintaining and expanding the system's data.

### Main Concepts Used

-   **Inheritance:** `Applicant` inherits from `Person`. `CareerGui` inherits from `JFrame`.
-   **Interfaces:** `CareerEngine` implements `RecommenderInterface`, ensuring a standard contract for recommendation logic.
-   **Exception Handling:** `try-catch` blocks are used extensively to handle `SQLException` and `NumberFormatException`. A custom `NoCareerFoundException` is thrown when logic fails to find a match.
-   **Collections Framework:** `ArrayList` is used to manage lists of skills and career results. `HashSet` is used to track selected skills efficiently.
-   **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Used for all database operations.
