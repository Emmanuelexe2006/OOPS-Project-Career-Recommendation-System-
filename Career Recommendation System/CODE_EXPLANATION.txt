  AI-BASED CAREER RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM - CODE EXPLANATION
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This is a Java-based desktop application that recommends careers based on user 
skills. It features a modern dark-themed GUI with neon effects, skill search 
functionality, and SQLite database integration.


SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
-------------------
The application follows a layered architecture:
1. Presentation Layer (GUI) - CareerGui.java
2. Business Logic Layer - CareerEngine.java
3. Data Access Layer - SQLite Database
4. Model Classes - Person.java, Applicant.java
5. Utilities - DatabaseSetup.java, AdminCLI.java


================================================================================
FILE-BY-FILE EXPLANATION
================================================================================

1. Main.java
------------
PURPOSE: Application entry point
FUNCTIONALITY:
  - Initializes the SQLite database
  - Launches the GUI on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)
  - Uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() for thread-safe GUI creation

KEY CODE:
  DatabaseSetup.initializeDatabase();  // Creates/populates database
  new CareerGui().setVisible(true);     // Shows main window


2. CareerGui.java
-----------------
PURPOSE: Main graphical user interface
COMPONENTS:
  - Dark-themed UI with custom colors (BG_COLOR, CARD_COLOR, ACCENT_COLOR)
  - Left panel: User input (name, age, skills)
  - Right panel: Career recommendations
  
KEY FEATURES:
  a) Skill Search Bar:
     - Real-time filtering as user types
     - Filters skills using case-insensitive contains matching
     - filterSkills(String searchText) method
  
  b) Skill Selection:
     - Checkboxes with custom dark icons
     - "Deselect All" button to clear selections
     - Scrollable list of all available skills
  
  c) Neon Glow Effects:
     - Best match recommendation has multi-layer glow effect
     - Custom paintComponent() override for visual effects
     - Uses Graphics2D with antialiasing for smooth rendering
  
  d) Custom UI Elements:
     - DarkCheckBoxIcon: Custom checkbox appearance
     - DarkScrollBarUI: Minimal dark scrollbar
     - Blended text fields with underline borders
     - Rounded accent-colored buttons

METHOD BREAKDOWN:
  - refreshSkills(): Loads all skills from database
  - filterSkills(String): Filters skills based on search text
  - deselectAllSkills(): Unchecks all skill checkboxes
  - getRecommendations(): Validates input and calls recommendation engine
  - updateResults(List<String>): Displays career matches with neon effects
  - createPrimaryButton(String): Creates green accent buttons
  - createBlendedField(): Creates dark-themed text fields


3. CareerEngine.java
--------------------
PURPOSE: Core recommendation logic and database operations
IMPLEMENTS: RecommenderInterface

KEY METHODS:
  a) recommend(Applicant applicant):
     - Retrieves all careers from database
     - Converts user skills to lowercase for matching
     - Splits skills by comma into arrays
     - Compares each career's required skills with user skills
     - Counts matches for each career
     - Creates CareerScore objects (title + score)
     - Sorts careers by match score (descending)
     - Returns sorted list of career titles
  
  b) getAllSkills():
     - Queries database for all career skills
     - Splits comma-separated skills
     - Returns unique, sorted list of all skills
  
  c) addCareer(String, String, String):
     - Inserts new career into database
     - Used by admin interface
     - Uses PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection
  
  d) logActivity(String):
     - Writes timestamped log entries to activity_log.txt
     - Tracks user actions and errors

ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
  Skill Matching Algorithm:
  1. For each career in database:
     - Get required skills (comma-separated string)
     - Split into individual skills
     - For each required skill:
       * Check if user has this skill
       * Increment match counter if found
     - If matches > 0, add to results with score
  2. Sort results by match score (highest first)
  3. Return career titles in sorted order

INNER CLASS:
  - CareerScore: Helper class to store career title and match count


4. RecommenderInterface.java
-----------------------------
PURPOSE: Contract for recommendation systems
DEFINES: recommend(Applicant) method signature
BENEFIT: Allows for multiple recommendation implementations

2. Database initializes with career data
3. GUI displays with dark theme
4. User enters:
   - Full name
   - Age
   - Searches for and selects relevant skills
5. User clicks "Find Careers" button
6. System:
   - Validates input (checks for empty fields)
   - Creates Applicant object
   - Calls CareerEngine.recommend()
   - Matches skills against all careers
   - Sorts by best match
7. Results display:
   - Best match highlighted with neon green glow
   - "BEST MATCH" label at top
   - Other recommendations listed below

SKILL MATCHING EXAMPLE:
  User skills: ["java", "python", "problem solving"]
  
  Career A: "Software Developer"
    Required: ["java", "python", "algorithms"]
    Matches: 2 (java, python) → Score: 2
  
  Career B: "Data Scientist"  
    Required: ["python", "statistics", "machine learning"]
    Matches: 1 (python) → Score: 1
  
  Result: Career A ranked first (higher score)
